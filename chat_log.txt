User: can you describe fully how solars work
Bot: Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. When sunlight hits the panels, the photovoltaic cells create a flow of electrons, generating direct current (DC) electricity. This electricity is then sent to an inverter, which converts it into alternating current (AC) electricity that can power your home or business.
